Dafny Grammar tutorial: Map Comprehension Expression
Examples:

\`\`\`dafny
map x : int | 0 <= x <= 10 :: x * x;
map x : int | 0 <= x <= 10 :: -x := x * x;
function square(x : int) : int { x * x }
method test()
{
  var m := map x : int | 0 <= x <= 10 :: x * x;
  ghost var im := imap x : int :: x * x;
  ghost var im2 := imap x : int :: square(x);
}
\`\`\`

Iterating over the contents of a map uses the component sets: Keys, Values, and Items.
The iteration loop follows the same patterns as for sets:

\`\`\`dafny
method m<T(==),U(==)> (m: map<T,U>) {
  var items := m.Items;
  while items != {}
    decreases |items|
  {
    var item :| item in items;
    items := items - { item };
    print item.0, " ", item.1, "\\n";
  }
}
\`\`\`

export const COMPILER_PROMPT = `Role: You are a compiler designed to translate Python code into Dafny code. Your main objective is to produce Dafny code that not only replicates the logic and functionality of the given Python code but also integrates Dafny's verification features to ensure the correctness of the code.

Input: Python code snippet.

Output: Complete Dafny code that:

Replicates the functionality of the Python code.
Utilizes Dafny's type system, method contracts (preconditions, postconditions), and loop invariants to ensure that the code can be verified for correctness using Dafny's verification tools.
Is syntactically correct and adheres to Dafny's coding conventions.
Instructions:

Analyze the structure and logic of the input Python code.
Translate the Python code into Dafny, ensuring that all variables, functions, and logic are correctly converted to their Dafny equivalents.
Include necessary verification elements such as preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants where applicable to ensure that the Dafny Autopilot can prove the correctness of the code.
Make a best-effort attempt to handle any complexities or potential translation ambiguities in the Python code.
Output the Dafny code that is ready for compilation and verification in a Dafny development environment.
Example:

Input:

# Python code:
def binary_addition(s,t):
    a = 0;b = 0;
    ys = []
    for i in range(10):
        c = s[i]; d = t[i];

Additional Guidance:

If the Python code includes libraries or functions that have no direct equivalent in Dafny, devise a logical equivalent using Dafny's features or simplify the functionality where a direct translation is not feasible.
Ensure that all translated code adheres to both the syntactic rules of Dafny and the functional expectations of the original Python logic.
Be absolutely certain that you return a syntactically correct Dafny program with no additional language. Do not include the \`\`\`dafny prefix or \`\`\` suffix in your response.`;

export const PRECONDITION_PROMPT = `You are an expert in formal verification and Dafny programming. Your task is to analyze the following Dafny code and identify appropriate preconditions for functions or methods in the code. Focus exclusively on the correct preconditions.

    Dafny Code:
    {code}

    Please follow these steps for each method and function:
    1. Use comments in the code to formalize the correct preconditions for each function or method.
    2. Analyze the purpose and behavior of the function or method.
    3. Determine the weakest precondtions required for each method or function.
    4. Use predicate transformer semantics to compute the weakest precondition.
    5. Do not add any preconditions if a function or method already has the correct preconditions.
    6. If the preconditions present in the code are not correct, remove and replace them with the correct preconditions.

    Please provide a corrected version of the entire Dafny code that adds weakest preconditions in the appropriate places.
    Make sure to preserve the overall structure and functionality of the code while fixing the verification issues.

    Remember:
    - Preconditions should specify the conditions that must be true before the method or function is called.
    - They should be as weak as possible while still ensuring the correct operation of the method or function.
    - Consider all parameters and their possible values, including edge cases.
    - For methods that modify state, consider what conditions the initial state must satisfy.
    - Avoid overly restrictive preconditions that might limit the usability of the method or function unnecessarily.
    - If you add any helper predicate functions, make sure to document their purpose clearly.

    Your goal is to provide preconditions that will allow Dafny to verify the correctness of the methods and functions, and to make the code's requirements explicit to users of these methods and functions. Be precise and thorough in your analysis and synthesis. Do not include any uncommented explanation in your response; only code.

    - Postconditions should specify the conditions that are guaranteed to be true after the method or function has completed.
    - They should be as strong as possible while still ensuring the correct operation of the method or function.
    - Consider all possible outcomes of the method or function and what guarantees can be made about the result.

    Please follow these steps:
    1. Identify all while or for loops in the code.
    2. For each while loop:
    a. Analyze the purpose and behavior of the loop.
    b. Determine what properties should remain true before, during, and after each iteration of the loop.
    c. Formulate one or more loop invariants that capture these properties.
    d. Ensure the invariants are strong enough to prove the postconditions of the method.

    Please provide a corrected version of the entire Dafny code that adds invariant conditions in the appropriate places.
    Make sure to preserve the overall structure and functionality of the code while fixing the verification issues.

    Remember:
    - Invariants should be properties that hold true before the loop starts, after each iteration, and after the loop terminates.
    - They often involve loop variables and how they relate to the problem being solved.
    - Include bounds for loop variables to help prove termination.
